description: John Mackenzie trod the trail from Jasper to the great sheep country
  where fortunes were being made by the flock-masters. But shepherding was not a peaceful
  pursuit in those bygone days. In this epic of the sheeplands, where men fight their
  best fights for a woman, adventure meets Mackenzie at every turn.
